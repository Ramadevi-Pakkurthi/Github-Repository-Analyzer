# ⚙️ How to Run the Project

## 📌 Prerequisites

- ☕ Java 17 or higher  
- 📦 Maven  

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Rajesh-Killadi/CloudEagle_Repository_Analyzer.git

```

---

## 2️⃣ Navigate inside the project

```
cd CloudEagle_Repository_Analyzer

```
---

## 3️⃣ Run the Application

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

## 🔐 Login with GitHub

After starting the application, open the following URL in your browser:

http://localhost:8080/login

- Click on **GitHub**
- You will be redirected to GitHub for authentication
- After successful login, you will be redirected to Swagger UI

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

# 📡 API Usage

## ✅ Endpoint

GET /report/{orgName}

👉 Replace orgName with your actual GitHub organization name.

---

## ✅ Sample Response

{
  "Rajesh": ["RepoA", "RepoB"],
  "Ram": ["RepoA"]
}

👉 Meaning:

* **Rajesh** has access to RepoA and RepoB
* **Ram** has access to RepoA

---

# 🧠 Design Decisions

* Used **OAuth2** for secure authentication
* Used **RestTemplate** for GitHub API calls
* Used **CompletableFuture** for parallel processing (performance optimization)
* Used **ConcurrentHashMap** for thread-safe aggregation
* Implemented pagination to fetch all repositories and collaborators efficiently

# ⚠️ Important Notes: Access Requirements for Organization Repositories


👉 You must login using an organization admin account to access the organization repositories

---
# ⚠️ Troubleshooting: Private Repositories Not Visible

If the API returns only public repositories and not private ones, it is likely due to GitHub organization restrictions.

🔍 Reason

GitHub organizations can restrict access to private repositories for OAuth applications, even if the user has access.

✅ Solution

Follow these steps to allow access:

Open your GitHub Organization
Navigate to:

Settings → Third-party access → OAuth App Policy -> Remove Restriction
"# Github-Repository-Analyzer" 
"# Github-Repository-Analyzer"
